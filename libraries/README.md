Virtual memory is not the total memory consumed. It is only a theoratical consumption

Only Resident and Shared memory is consumed.

`malloc` is not allocated unless it is used

When in your gcc you use the `-I` command to include the directory, you include the header file with `<file.h>` instead of `"file.h"`

`/usr/lib` is native libraries installed with the OS

`/usr/local/lib` are libraries installed by the user
